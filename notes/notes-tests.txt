Tests to run. 
In all cases these should be compared with Firefox's and/or Chrome's rendering of the SVG.

1. Elliptical arc - Test all aspects of elliptical arcs. E.g. that the radius is correctly scaled and 
	that the flags are handled correctly. 

2. Colors - Test that all color specification works as intended. 
			Test for cases where srgb_to_linear is not used. 

3. Test inheritance of transforms, styles, etc. 

4. Paths - Test all path elements in all combinations (e.g. T following M etc). 
           Test all relative commands. 

5. viewBox - Different tests with different aspect ratios etc. 

6. Transforms - Test all transforms, e.g. skewing a rectangle with rounded corners.
