1. Refactor curve creation code in svgparser.py. Perhaps utilize Bezier and Curve classes. 
2. Move utility functions of all classes to separate module. 
3. Performance and bug testing. 
4. Consider using slots in Bezier and Curve classes. 
5. Add so that Bezier can accept optional transformation matrix when inited or at later stage (probably when using add_to_Blender(). 
6. Refactor lazy evaluation of Bezier and Curve properties. Either use @property or descriptors (probably the earlier one). 
7.
