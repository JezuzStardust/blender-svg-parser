Method: 

1. User calls SVGLoader() with Blender context, file path and two options relating to the origin. 
	 - This inits the SVGLoader to default values and calls super class (SVGGeometryContainer). 
	 - This is in turn initialized with no geometries and calls the base class SCGGeometry init.
	 - The SVGLoader is then fully inited.
2. User calls parse(). 
	- This method is not found in SVGLoader, but instead in SVGGeometryContainer.
	- This first calls SVGGeometry.parse, but this does nothing since self._node is not of type xml.dom.minidom.Element (it is xml.dom.minidom.Document). 
	- Then it continues in SVGGeometryContainer. 
	- For each childNode it uses the tagName to init a new geoemtry class and then parse that. 
	- Since some childNodes will themselves be containers, this method will be called recursively. 



Think about a better way to do all this!
I think it would be easier to handle all this if the SVGLoader has more responsibility for creating the hierarchy.
