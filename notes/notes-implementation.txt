1. 	Write a separate class for Bezier curves.
	- Should be able to handle curves, e.g. splitting, finding exterma etc. 
	- Finding self intersections.
	- Should be able to 'print' itself to Blender. 
	- In long run also add possibility to make it grease pencil itself. 

2. 	Write a separate class for curves (collection of Bezier curves. 
	- Think about how to handle the fact that the point of the current and
	  next curves are the same (unless we jump). 
	- Should be able to print itself to Blender. 
	- Should have a way of finding intersections (including single Bezier self
	  intersections). 

5. For simplicity we can also consider writing a special class for points. 
   These can be converted to mathutils.Vectors when it is time to add them to 
   Blender. 

4. 	Use these two classes for all curve creation in the plugin. 
	E.g. a rounded rectangle should use these.
