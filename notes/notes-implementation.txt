Since all geometry creating classes (e.g. rectangle, path, etc) are converted to one or more cubic Bezier curves we can introduce a self.splines list which contains all splines. The format for each spline should be considered carefully. 
Perhaps the following would do: 

point: simply a mathutils.Vector

- Bezier: a basic Bezier curve with two end points and two handles. Each of this is a point (mathutils.Vector). 
  Two different Bezier curves can contain the same instance of a point in case the two curves are connected. 

- Spline: An ordered list of multiple Bezier curves where the end point of the previous Bezier and the starting point of the next are the same. 
  There should be a property which says is the spline is cyclic or not. 

- Curve: A list of multiple splines. E.g. a representation of the letter A contains two splines: one for the outer and one for the inner outline. 

Each SVGGeometry can then contain a curve object. 


Alternative with Bezier class. 
1. 	Write a separate class for Bezier curves.
	- Finding self intersections?
	- In long run also add possibility to make it grease pencil itself. 

2. 	Write a separate class for curves (collection of Bezier curves).
	- End and starting points of subsequent Bezier:s should coincide (or preferably be the same mathutils.Vector instance). 
	- Find intersections.

3. 	Use these two classes for all curve creation in the plugin. 
	E.g. a rounded rectangle should use these. 

splines consists of many Bezier curves. 

splines = [B1, B2, B3, ...] 

[(i, ti, j, t), ...]  or (i, j, t_i, t_j)? 


{'1': [(1,t11), (3,t13), (4,t13)], '3': [(1,t31)], }

Probably does not matter much. 




Bezier

def _get_reduced(self) # Fixed. 

	return self.reduced


def intersections(self, bezier): 
	c1 = self.reduced
	c2 bezier.reduced
	
	do recursive finding. 
	return [(t1, t2), ...] 

def self_intersections(self):
	cc = self.reduced
	d = itertools.combinations(cc, 2)
	... 
	

Curve

def intersections(self):
	make list of each pair
	check which pairs overlap
	call bezier1.intersections(bezier2) and store in intersection list
	also store index for each curve.
